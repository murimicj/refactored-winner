Step one since we are all beginners I prefer using what we call youtube univeristy. I will be using freecodecamp as a major reference point #freecodecamp university.I have three months to understand Java programming though am in third year at Kabarak University.
I prefer to treat myself as a begginner as i embark on this 3 month journey. 
What is springboot? QUOTING GOOGLE("Spring Boot makes it easy to create satnd alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you an "just run"
Basically by the end of this three months i will have attained the necessary skills to be able to " just run" 
All these in mind i have to embark on a team projct on the start of January.
Now just to touch on cloud computing. What is cloud computing?The practise of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store , manage , and process data, rather than a local sever or a personalcomputer
If time allows i will also do abit on webdevelopment. This is basically then work involved in developing a website for the internet or an intranet . I will be posting codes to a simple begginer website i did in secind year under the guidance of my lecturer Madam Daisy.
